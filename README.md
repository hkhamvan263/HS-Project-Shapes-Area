# High School Project: Shape's Area

I recreated a project I did during my sophomore year of high school, in Computer Programming I Honors, with code that I did not add to my project.  

This repository is a work in progress.  

To get the entire code, I recommend downloading the zip file. 

This code is under construction and subjected to honor code.
